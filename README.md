### My PLP Final Project:
## AI POWER DRIVEN REMOTE PATIENT MONITORING APP(RPM) FOR GOOD HEALTH AND WELLBEING

## üîç Project Overview:
The project aims to develop an AI-powered Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) application software that enables continuous, real-time health monitoring for individuals living with chronic diseases, particularly in low-resource and under-deserved communities. The system will integrate wearable sensors, mobile health (mHealth) technologies, and AI algorithms to track vital signs such as heart rate, blood pressure, blood glucose levels, and oxygen saturation. Using predictive analytics and anomaly detection, the software will provide timely alerts to healthcare providers and caregivers, enabling proactive interventions and reducing the risk of health complications and hospitalizations.

The application will be designed for accessibility, scalability, and data privacy, with features tailored to the needs of rural healthcare delivery, including low-bandwidth communication, multilingual interfaces, and integration with telehealth platforms.


## üåç Project Key Objectives:

Develop AI models to detect abnormal health patterns and predict potential risks.

Integrate wearable devices and mobile platforms for seamless patient data collection.

Enable remote alerts and communication between patients and healthcare providers.

Ensure usability and accessibility for users in low-resource settings.

Support health equity through affordable and inclusive digital health tools.


## üõ†Ô∏è Project Core Features:

Real-time monitoring dashboard for clinicians.

AI-powered alerts for abnormal health trends.

Patient app for tracking health metrics and medication adherence.

Offline support and low-data mode for remote locations.

Multilingual support and simple UX for digital inclusion.
